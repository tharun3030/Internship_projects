# Task 2-Iris Classification

This project provides an implementation of a machine learning model for classifying iris flower species based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview

The project script `iris_classification.py` is structured to:

- Load and Preprocess Data: Load the iris dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing.
- Train a Classification Model: Train a machine learning model on the dataset to classify iris species based on the input features.
- Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need Python installed with the following libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is widely available and can be accessed through the `scikit-learn` library's datasets module. This project uses it directly from the library.

## Project Structure

- iris_classification.py: Contains the full implementation of loading, training, and evaluating the model.
