# Task 1-Iris Flowers Classification

This project provides an implementation of a machine learning model for classifying iris flower species based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview

The project script `iris_classification.py` is structured to:

- Load and Preprocess Data: Load the iris dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing.
- Train a Classification Model: Train a machine learning model on the dataset to classify iris species based on the input features.
- Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need Python installed with the following libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is widely available and can be accessed through the `scikit-learn` library's datasets module. This project uses it directly from the library.

## Project Structure

- iris_classification.py: Contains the full implementation of loading, training, and evaluating the model.

The file appears to be a Python script for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the ResNet50 model as a base, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data preprocessing, model building, and training steps for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here’s a suggested GitHub README description for the project:

# Task 2-Image Classification with ResNet50 on CIFAR-10

This project implements an image classification model using the ResNet50 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and uses data augmentation and fine-tuning for improved performance.

## Features

- Dataset: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Preprocessing: Normalizes pixel values and applies data augmentation techniques, including rotation, shifting, and horizontal flipping.
- Model Architecture: Uses ResNet50 as the base model with fine-tuning to improve accuracy, unfreezing only the last few layers.
- Training: Includes learning rate scheduling and an optimizer (Adam) for efficient training.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- CIFAR-10 dataset (loaded automatically)

## Usage

To train the model:
```python
python image_classification.py
```

This script will preprocess the data, build and train the model, and display the accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Here’s a sample README description for the provided `fraud_detection.py` file, assuming it’s a Python script designed to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset.

# Task 3-Fraud Detection

This Python script, `fraud_detection.py`, implements a machine learning-based approach to detect fraudulent transactions. It processes credit card transaction data to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. This solution can help in preventing fraud by identifying suspicious activities in financial datasets.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares transaction data for model training and evaluation.
- Feature Engineering: Transforms and selects important features that enhance the model’s accuracy in detecting fraud.
- Model Training: Uses a classification model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, to learn patterns in the data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Prediction: Classifies new transactions based on the trained model and identifies potential fraud cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To run the fraud detection script, use the following command:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

The script reads in a dataset of transactions, trains a model on labeled data, and outputs metrics indicating the model’s performance. 

## Example Dataset

Ensure that you have a CSV file containing credit card transaction data with features like:
- `Transaction Amount`
- `Transaction Time`
- `Merchant ID`
- `Customer ID`
- `Fraud Label` (1 for fraudulent, 0 for legitimate)

The script assumes a dataset format where each row represents a transaction and each column represents a transaction feature.

## Model and Evaluation

The script trains a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) to detect fraud. Key evaluation metrics include:

- Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- Precision: Measures the proportion of actual fraud cases among the transactions flagged as fraudulent.
- Recall: Measures the proportion of correctly identified fraud cases out of all actual fraud cases.
- F1 Score: Balances precision and recall to provide a single performance measure.

These metrics help gauge the model’s effectiveness and reliability in detecting fraud.
